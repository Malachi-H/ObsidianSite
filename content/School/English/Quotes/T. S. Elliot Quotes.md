## The Long Song of J. Alfred Prufrock

___
Opening Line of The Long Song of J. Alfred Prufrock
?
> Let us go then, you and I, <!--SR:!2023-11-01,66,268-->

Establishes a sense of exploration (aided by [epigraph](https://www.litcharts.com/literary-devices-and-terms/epigraph)) 
Epigraph > The extract takes place in the 8th level of hell, the place for false councillors. Causes us to question the objectivity of the poem. Cements it as Prufrock's subjective beliefs. 

___
Repeated refrain 1

>In the room the women come and go / Talking of Michelangelo.

Dismissive of the women who he believes lack intellectual capability and are only "*talking of Michelangelo*" due to his canonisation.  

___

Repeated [refrain](https://poemanalysis.com/literary-device/refrain/) 2
?
> "There will be time" <!--SR:!2023-09-25,29,268-->

Comforting himself in response to his to his looming dread about his mortality.

___
Hamlet allusion 
?
>”No! I am not Prince Hamlet, nor was meant to be;  / Am an attendant lord…” <!--SR:!2023-09-13,11,208-->

References prince hamlet. Hamlet - the archetype of inaction - is to good for Prufrock. He characterises himself a Polonius - the father of hamlets deceased lover. (who is entirely useless)

Allusion to Hamlet through the use of iambic pentameter. Breaks in the line

> “Deferential, glad to be of use,”

Reason: shows his insincerity at being glad to be of use.  


Should probably have looked at synecdoche (fragmentation) and the objectification/ hipocracy 

___
___

## Preludes

___

>The winter evening settles down / With smell of steaks in passageways.

Sibilance (repetition of 's' sound) subverted from the conventional use of emulating nature - becomes the sound of wind through empty streets. Used to remove humanity from the scene.

___

>And at the corner of the street / A lonely cab-horse steams and stamps.

Most human thing is a cab-horse which is "*immobilised*" and "*lonely*"  

>And then the lighting of the lamps.

The above line completes the [heroic couplet](https://poemanalysis.com/literary-device/heroic-couplet/) but employs typographical distancing to create a sense of separation from from the light. The light will only reveal the [depravity](https://duckduckgo.com/?q=depravity&t=newext&atb=v387-7&ia=definition) of modernity.

___

> The morning comes to consciousness 

Personified - most human thing in part 2
clinical language - discomfort 

___

Even the feet belong to the morning:

>With all its muddy feet that press

>One thinks of all the hands / That are raising dingy shades / In a thousand furnished rooms.

Use of synecdoche to enhance isolation through the removal of humanity. 
 
___

### Newspapers

> Of withered leaves about your feet / And newspapers from vacant lots;

Fragmentation + motif of modernity (lifeless communication)

> You curled the papers from your hair,

Soiled her hands

> The worlds revolve like ancient women / Gathering fuel in vacant lots.

Adding the the ash and smoke of the city + old women not being cared for

___
