[[Reminders]]

Feeling very unproductive and stressed.

Second Week of Trails:
- Physics on Monday
- Maths Ext 2 on Tuesday
- Maths Ext 1 on Wednesday

Major Works
- Multimedia Major work due Thursday night
	- I'm not sure how much I should be prioritising this over the trails given that It contributes directly to the HCS.
