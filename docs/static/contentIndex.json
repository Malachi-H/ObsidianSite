Causes us to question the objectivity of the poem. Cements it as Prufrock’s subjective beliefs.\n\nRepeated refrain 1\n\nIn the room the women come and go / Talking of Michelangelo.\n\nDismissive of the women who he believes lack intellectual capability and are only ”talking of Michelangelo” due to his canonisation.\n\nRepeated refrain 2\n?\n\n“There will be time” \n\nComforting himself in response to his to his looming dread about his mortality.\n\nHamlet allusion\n?\n\n”No! I am not Prince Hamlet, nor was meant to be;  / Am an attendant lord…” \n\nReferences prince hamlet. Hamlet - the archetype of inaction - is to good for Prufrock. He characterises himself a Polonius - the father of hamlets deceased lover. (who is entirely useless)\nAllusion to Hamlet through the use of iambic pentameter.

The light will only reveal the depravity of modernity.\n\n\nThe morning comes to consciousness\n\nPersonified - most human thing in part 2\nclinical language - discomfort\n\nEven the feet belong to the morning:\n\nWith all its muddy feet that press\n\n\nOne thinks of all the hands / That are raising dingy shades / In a thousand furnished rooms.\n\nUse of synecdoche to enhance isolation through the removal of humanity.\n\nNewspapers §\n\nOf withered leaves about your feet / And newspapers from vacant lots;\n\nFragmentation + motif of modernity (lifeless communication)\n\nYou curled the papers from your hair,\n\nSoiled her hands\n\nThe worlds revolve like ancient women / Gathering fuel in vacant lots.\n\nAdding the the ash and smoke of the city + old women not being cared for\n"},"School/English/Quotes/The-Merchant-of-Venice-Quotes":{"title":"The Merchant of Venice Quotes","links":["School/English/Shylock","Vocabulary/Vocabulary"],"tags":["flashcards","quotes","english"],"content":"Portia to Bassanio §\nhint: gentle spirit\r\n?\n\n“her gentle spirit / Commits itself to yours to be directed / As from her lord, her governor, her king.”  \n\nThe use of the feminine ending in the line “Commits itself to yours to be directed” indicates her discomfort at the prospect of relinquishing control.\n\nGratiano to Shylock §\nhint: zoomorphic insults\r\n?\n\n “O, be thou damned, inexecrable dog” (4.1.132)\r\n“Thy currish spirit / Governed a wolf” (4.1.135-136) \n\nUses of zoomorphic insults to dehumanise and degrade shylock.\n\nShylock §\n\n“If you prick us, do we not bleed? if you tickle us, do we not laugh? if you poison us, do we not die? and if you wrong us, shall we not revenge?
